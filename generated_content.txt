Subject: URGENT: Immediate Action Needed for Compliance Checks

Hey Charlie,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss a critical oversight we've identified in the compliance audits for the Subscription service areas (JIRA Issue PL-57560). During our review, we noticed that the necessary AWS configurations and VPN details haven't been updated as per the latest security protocols, which could pose a significant risk given our current audit phase.

We need to address this immediately to avoid any non-compliance penalties and potential security breaches. Could you please update the AWS credentials and VPN passwords by EOD today? Here’s the quick link to the document where you can update the details directly: [Phishing URL]

Also, could you verify whether the staging/warehouse logins mentioned in your recent update on JIRA ticket PL-57666 are still valid? We need to ensure everything is locked down tight. Here’s the link to the JIRA ticket for your reference: [Legitimate JIRA Link]

I understand it's short notice, but we really need to push this through by the end of the day to stay on track. Thanks for handling this as a priority.

Best regards,
