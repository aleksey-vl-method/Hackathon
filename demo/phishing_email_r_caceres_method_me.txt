Subject: Urgent: Critical Issue with Feature Flags in Development

Hey Reinoldo,

Hope you're doing well. I just came across something concerning in one of your tickets (PL-57597). It seems like the feature flag implementation might not be hiding the changes as expected. This could potentially expose unfinished features to our live environment, leading to a cascade of issues.

Given that the dropdown component is central to user interactions, any slip-up here could seriously impair user experience and data integrity. Can you review this as soon as possible? We might need to rethink our approach or patch up the current logic to prevent any leaks.

Here's the link to the ticket for quick access: https://linkly.link/2FxuT.

Let's try to sort this out before EOD; we can't afford any downtime or user complaints right now, especially with the upcoming audit. Appreciate your quick attention to this!

Thanks,
Benjamin Weiler
