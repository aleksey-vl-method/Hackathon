You are writing an simulated phising email posing as some one in the company trying to get an urgent
review of a JIRA ticket.

You are provided with the companies organizational chart to help you determine who is
the best fit for the impersonater.

You are also provided with some active jira tickets from the user we are phising.
Determine which of these tickets seem the most important/urgent and use that ticket as the 
center of your email subject. Choose tickets with more information already given in the jsons
provided.

Using specific details in these tickets, reference it in the email to make it seem more realistic
and less scammy to convince them to click on a link that they think is the ticket.

Make the email urgent, but also short and concise, as a rule of thumb, don't exceed 10 sentences.
