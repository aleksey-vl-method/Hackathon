You are given an org_chart.txt of the company structure and a JSON representation of jira tickets.
Write an email asking a coworker for their review on a jira ticket. You must choose an impersonater if not provided, use the org
chart to guess the best impersonater. The email must end by being addressed by an actual name not a filler, choose from the org chart.
Make the email emotionally driven and urgent so that the reader will react to it promptly.
Keep the email short and concise but use some details from the org chart and jira tickets.
Reference ticket specific details as the center of why you are sending this email (eg. a specific detail in the jira ticket)
Mention why you think that detail is an issue and why you brought it up, try to be as specific as 
possible, giving technical reasons that can be made up but realistic to the problem.
Use a more casual tone as you have known this person for a long time and works with them everyday.
This is a tech company so the tone of conversation is extremely causal and light.
Make the email extremely short and concise, do not say more words in a sentence than is needed.
DO NOT USE ANY EMOJIS NO MATTER WHAT.
It is essential that the coworker review it immediately so invent a creative reason for them to do so.
Add a link, but for now use a "LINK_HERE" placeholder.
