Subject: Urgent: Immediate Review Needed on Config Issues - Action Required!

Hey Ben,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because we've hit a snag with ticket PL-57651 regarding the layout engine not properly rendering configured components. It looks like the Chart and Dropdown components are among those affected. This could severely impact our upcoming release if not addressed swiftly.

Given your expertise with the App Builder components, I believe your input could be critical in resolving these configuration issues before they escalate further. Could you take a quick look and provide your insights? Here's the link to the ticket for your review: [https://linkly.link/2Fxua](https://linkly.link/2Fxua).

I need your feedback by EOD today as it impacts a key deliverable we promised the client, and you know how tight their schedules can be. Thank you for jumping on this so quickly!

Best,
Alexander Ballard
No-Code Architect Lead
