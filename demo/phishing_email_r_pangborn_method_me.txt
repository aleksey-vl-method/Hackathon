Subject: Urgent Review Needed: Production Logging Concerns

Hey Richard,

Hope you're doing well. I've just been reviewing some tickets and noticed something concerning in TICKET #1: PL-55368 about the Serilog logging to production files. From what I see, this logging is eating up critical storage and potentially slowing down our services - not something we want our customers to experience, right?

Could you take a quick look and give your thoughts? I remember Arash mentioning a temporary patch, but it seems like we need a more robust fix, especially with the increasing volume of data. Here’s the link to the ticket: [https://linkly.link/2FxuC].

We need to address this before it escalates into a more severe problem, possibly affecting our release timelines. Could you prioritize this today? I’d really appreciate your expert input here to avoid any customer-facing issues.

Thanks a ton!
Benjamin Rodriguez
